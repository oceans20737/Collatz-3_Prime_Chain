# 3-adic Collatz Prime Chains

A research project exploring rare prime number sequences generated by a 3-adic Collatz-like map:

    If n ≡ 1 (mod 3):  f(n) = (4n − 1) / 3
    If n ≡ 2 (mod 3):  f(n) = (4n + 1) / 3
    If n ≡ 0 (mod 3):  stop

This repository documents the discovery of a **length-8 prime chain**, found through a full search up to 6×10^8.

## Overview

While the classical Collatz conjecture concerns eventual convergence to 1,  
local behaviors of Collatz-like maps can produce *increasing* sequences that remain prime for several steps.

In this project, we study a 3-adic linear fractional transformation that always returns an integer and branches depending on n mod 3.  
Restricting the orbit to primes yields a generalized Cunningham chain.

A complete computational search revealed a **unique 8-term prime chain** within the tested range.

## The Discovered Length-8 Chain

The following 8 consecutive primes satisfy  
p(i+1) = (4*p(i) ± 1) / 3,  
with the sign determined by p(i) mod 3:

    46000363
    61333817
    81778423
    109037897
    145383863
    193845151
    258460201
    344613601

This is the **only maximal chain of length ≥ 8** found below 6×10^8.

## Mathematical Notes

### 3-adic branching
The map depends entirely on n mod 3:

- 1 → (4n − 1)/3  
- 2 → (4n + 1)/3  

This ensures integrality and creates a branching structure absent in classical Cunningham chains.

### Growth rate
The map grows approximately as:

    f(n) ≈ (4/3)n

Combined with the decreasing density of primes, long chains become extremely rare.

### Uniqueness
No other chain of length 8 or longer was found in the entire search range.  
Many shorter chains merge into this orbit, but none extend beyond it.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x  
- `sympy` for primality testing

Install dependencies:

    pip install sympy

### Usage

Run the exploration script:

    python collatz_3adic_prime_chain_exploration.py

Run the verification script (to check a specific chain):

    python collatz_3adic_prime_chain_verification.py

You can modify the search range or explore for longer chains.
